### Creating Custom Measures

2. Select the appropriate group for your custom measure:

   - Global measures
   - Public transport measures
   - Train measures

   - Bicycle measures
   - Carpooling measures
   - Electric vehicle measures
   - Professional measures (various categories)

### Using Custom Measures

Once created, custom measures appear alongside standard measures in the employer measures selection dropdowns. They can be selected for the company or for specific campaigns.

**Use cases for custom measures:**

- Pilot programs or temporary initiatives
- Location-specific measures (e.g., company-run ferry service)
- Specialized equipment or facilities

## Best Practices

### When Creating a Company

1. **Provide complete contact information**: This helps participants get answers to their questions
2. **Add multiple administrators**: Ensures continuity if one administrator is unavailable
3. **Select all applicable measures**: Accurate measure selection leads to better recommendations
4. **Use custom measures sparingly**: Only create custom measures for truly unique initiatives

### When Configuring Measures

1. **Review measures regularly**: Update as new initiatives launch or old ones end
2. **Consider both personal and professional travel**: Many companies focus on commuting but professional travel is equally important
3. **Be specific with custom measures**: Clear, descriptive labels help participants understand available options

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Custom measures not appearing

**Problem:** Custom measure was created but doesn't show in dropdowns
**Solution:**
