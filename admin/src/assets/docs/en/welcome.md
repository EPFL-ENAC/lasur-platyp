### A free tool to support you in your mobility strategy

The aim of the Mobility Toolkit is to build an easy-to-use tool that enables any organization to carry out a mobility analysis with a view to establishing or revising their mobility plan. The analysis focuses on both the mobility practices of employees and their desire for mobility, while taking into account personal and professional constraints.

It is a way for organizations to target the most relevant assistance to implement for their employees and to periodically assess the alignment of this assistance with their actual needs.

The tool is easy to use and has a low entry cost (completely free), making it particularly suitable for SMEs, although it can also complement mobility plans already in place.

**As an organization, why launch a campaign?**

- Target mobility assistance for employees
- Improve employee well-being and health at work
- Engage in a CSR approach that improves the organization's attractiveness
- Calculate and monitor the company's carbon footprint for mobility (scope 3, categories 6 and 7)

**As an employee, why take the 10-minute questionnaire?**

- To get personalized recommendations for my commutes and business trips
- To find out what assistance my organization can offer me for my mobility needs
- To anonymously communicate my mobility assistance needs and preferences to my employer
- To participate in a CSR initiative that benefits the organization and the health and well-being of employees
