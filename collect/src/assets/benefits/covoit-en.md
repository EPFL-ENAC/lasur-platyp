- Carpooling means dividing emissions by the number of occupants, as well as all the externalities of the car (congestion, pollution, noise)
- Hé Léman, Illicov, covoiturage-leman.org, e-covoiturage.ch, mov'ici… Initiatives to encourage carpooling are developing at a rapid pace, in parallel with favorable policies (P+R, reserved lanes)
