The advantages of intermodality:

- More and more offers are being developed to facilitate intermodality (public transport with public bike sharing, bike stands in stations, P+R subscriptions, etc.)
- Making part of your journey in a low-carbon and/or active way already makes a difference: every kilometer counts when it comes to health and/or environmental benefits
